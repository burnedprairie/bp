    <p class="title">Product Information</p>
    <p>
        All of our items are-made-to-order, potentially being sewed/printed/dyed on demand.
        Because of this, it may take up to 30 days to get your order ready for shipping as a result. We thank you in advance for your patience.
        <br><br>
        Qualities such as tie dye are one of one and the colors shown on the product image may not be the exact same as the one you receive (unless noted otherwise).
        <br><br>
        Most, if not all, of our packaging that you receive will be recyclable. Please do you part to help keep our planet clean. â™²
        <br><br>
        Washing instructions: Hand wash with cold water and let items air dry. Made with love, take care with love!
    </p>
    <p class="title">Return Policy</p>
    <p>
        Due to our items being made-to-order, there is always an exclusive quantity.
        Because of this, all sales are final *no refunds or exchanges*.
        <br><br>
        For incorrect, defective, or damaged items, please contact us immediately upon inspection of your order, so we can evaluate the issue and make it right.
    </p>
    <p class="title">Shipping</p>
    <p> An order confirmation will be sent via email once your order has been placed.
        A separate email with tracking information will be sent once the order has been processed and shipped.
        <br><br>
        Once packages are dropped off, we are not responsible for any shipping delays, damages, or lost goods that may occur while in transit.
        Unfortunately, we are unable to issue a refund/replacement for lost or stolen packages.
